[Multiples of 3 or 5](https://www.codewars.com/kata/multiples-of-3-or-5)

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

The task was to write a function that returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

```
function solution(number){
    if(number<=0) return 0;
    let n = (a) =>Math.floor((number-1)/a);
    let sum = (b, c) =>(1+b)*b/2*c;    
    return sum(n(3), 3)+sum(n(5), 5)-sum(n(15), 15);    
}
```
